# Smart Contracts â€“ Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the Solidity smart contracts used in the prototype system for my Bachelor's thesis.

## Contracts

- `AuditTrail.sol`: logs hashes and metadata for each processing step.
- `PublicKeyRegistry.sol`: registers and verifies machine TLS certificates and public keys.

The contracts are deployed to the Optimism Sepolia testnet and interact with four TEE-enabled machines and a central orchestrator.

## Note

This project is for academic use only and not intended for production.
